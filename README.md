# VBA Introduction
This is an introductory guide to Visual Basics for Applications (VBA). At its core, VBA is a scripting languauge that provides users with the ability to control the Microsoft Office envirnment programmatically.

Like most programming languages, VBA has a number of programming constructs that help to to extend its power and flexibility. Additionally it has a gentle learning curve that makes it a suitable first language for beginners in the world of programming.

This guide will offer a gentle introduction to VBA and its constructs. It is intended to provide readers with a solid foundation upon which to explore and extend their skills.

### Invoking the VBA Editor
The Microsoft Office suite provides a built-in code editor that allows users to code instructions relevant to the application. There are several ways to invoke your VBA Editor, depending on your operating system.<br>
For Windows
- Option 1: While holding the **Alt** key, press the function **F11** key (**Alt + F11**)
- Option 2: Select the Developer tab, then press the Visual Basic button to activate the VBA Editor

For MAC
- Option 1: While holding the **fn** + **Alt** keys, press the function **F11** key (**Alt + F11**)
- Option 2: Select the Developer tab, then press the Visual Basic button to activate the VBA Editor

Here a few key considerations before we begin our sample coding:
- To begin coding, we will enter our instructions in the blank area below general.
- These instructions that we enter are called statements or vba commands.
- to end and instruction we simple press the Enter / retun key
- Each new statement / command is placed on a separate line

  
### VBA Constructs
VBA offers some the most useful programming constructs, many of which will be familiar, if you have ever programmed in another language
